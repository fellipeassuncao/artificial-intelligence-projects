# Data Science Project

In this repository we have a set of projects related to Data Science that have as inputs, images and texts.

Among the algorithms used, we can highlight the Machine Learnign classification algorithms, such as SVM (Support Vector Machine), Naive Bayes and Random Forest.

Among the algorithms based on Deep Learning, we can mention the use of Convolutional Neural Networks such as VGG16, VGG19 and Resnet50. In addition, we have the use of a Recurrent Neural Network, the LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) for classification tasks.

## Ulcer Image Recognition (Medtech Dataset)

In this project, we created a new approach to segmentation of pressure ulcer images. We compared the influence of superpixels (DISF, SLIC, LSC, ERS, SNIC, SEEDS) in the segmentation process in the pre-processing stage and adapted the segmentation algorithms such as IFT and DynIFT in the post-processing stage. The inclusion of the DISF method in the pre-processing stage allowed an increase in the evaluation metrics, compared to previous results.

Within the languages and tools that I have been working with, I have adapted a Java program that offers a pipeline for the entire process that uses, among others, the OPENCV library and other computer vision resources. In addition, we use languages such as Matlab and Python to include new methods in the program's pipeline.

## [Handcrafted Features and Deep Features for Image Classification (Caltech 101 Dataset)](https://www.instagram.com/fellipeassuncao/)

Recognition of objects from the extraction of color features, associated with the penultimate layer of a CNN such as (Resnet50, VGG16 and VGG19). The results showed that the fusion of color descriptors with the second-to-last layer of CNN does not contribute to the increase in accuracy. Thus, CNNs perform well in the process of feature extraction and object recognition.

## Handwritten Digit Classification (Mnist Dataset)

Mnist is a dataset of 60,000 small grayscale 28Ã—28 pixel square images of handwritten digits between 0 and 9. The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes that represent integer values from 0 to 9, inclusive.

This is a widely used classification example and can be considered a "solved" problem, since its accuracy reaches very good values for CNNs, reaching more than 99%. From this example it is possible to understand the classification pipeline of a model, make an adjustment of the parameters, propose improvements from the analysis and visualization of the results.

## Fake News Detector (Fake News Dataset)

In this practice we will classify a text from classification algorithms based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).
