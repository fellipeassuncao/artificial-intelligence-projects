# Data Science Project

In this repository we have a set of projects related to Data Science that have as inputs, images and texts.

Among the algorithms used, we can highlight the Machine Learnign classification algorithms, such as SVM (Support Vector Machine), Naive Bayes and Random Forest.

Among the algorithms based on Deep Learning, we can mention the use of Convolutional Neural Networks such as VGG16, VGG19 and Resnet50. In addition, we have the use of a Recurrent Neural Network, the LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) for classification tasks.
